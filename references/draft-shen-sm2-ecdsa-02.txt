5.  Digital Signature Algorithm

5.1.  Digital Signature System

5.1.1.  General Rules

   In the digital signtature algorithm, one signer generate digital
   signature over given data and one verifier verifies the validation of
   the signature.  Each signer ownes one public key and one private key.
   The private key was used for signing and verifier verfifies the
   signature using the public key.  Before generation of the digital
   signature, the message M and ZA need to be compressed via a hash
   function; before the verification of the digital signature, the

5.2.  Generation of Signature

5.2.1.  Digital Signature Generation Algorithm

   Let M be the message for signing, in order to obtain the signature
   (r, s), the signer A need to perform the following:


   A1: set M~=ZA || M
   A2: calculate e=Hv(M~)
   A3: pick a random number k in [1, n-1] via a random number generator
   A4: calculate the elliptic curve point (x1, y1)=[k]G
   A5: calculate r=(e+x1) modn, return to A3 if r=0 or r+k=n
   A6: calculate s=((1+dA)^(-1)*(k-r*dA)) modn, return to A3 if s=0

B1: verify whether r' in [1,n-1], verification failed if not
B2: vefify whether s' in [1,n-1], verification failed if not
B3: set M'~=ZA || M'
B4: calculate e'=Hv(M'~)
B5: calculate t = (r' + s') modn, verification failed if t=0
B6: calculate the point (x1', y1')=[s']G + [t]PA
B7: calculate R=(e'+x1') modn, verfication pass if yes, otherwise failed

Note: The verification will certainly fail if ZA does not correspond to
      teh hash value of A.

6.  SM2 Key Exchange Protocol

6.1.  Parameters of the Algorithm and Auxiliary Functions

6.1.1.  General Rules

   In the key exchange protocol, user A and user B use respective
   private key and opposite public key to get agreement on a secret key
   only known by themselves through alternate communications.  The
   shared secret key is generally used in a symmetric cryptographic
   algorithm.  The key exchange protocol can be used in key management
   and key agreement.

6.1.2.  Parameters of Elliptic Curve System

   The parameters of an elliptic curve systme include the size q of a
   finite field Fq (when q=2^m, also include basis representation and
   irreducible polynomial); the two elements a and b (in Fq) which
   defines the elliptic curve equation; the base point G=(xG, yG) (G not
   euqals O), where xG and yG are ellements in Fq; the degree n of G and
   other optional parameter such as cofactor h.

6.1.3.  Key pairs

   The user A's key pair include his private key dA and public key
   PA=[dA]G=(xA, yA).  The user B's key pair include his private key dB
   and public key PB=[dB]G=(xB, yB).

6.1.4.  Auxiliary Functions

6.1.4.1.  Introduction

   The auxiliary functions in the elliptic curve key exchange protocol
   in this document include hash functions, key derivation function and
   random number generator.

Internet-Draft          SM2 Public Key Algorithms          February 2014


6.1.4.2.  Hash Function

   The sm2 key exchange protocol requires the hash functions approved by
   Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office, such as sm2.

6.1.4.3.  key derivation function


    The key derivation function is used for deriving a secret key from a shared
    secret bit string. In the process of key agreement, the key derivation function
    acts on a secret bit string shared through key exchange to generate a secret
    key used for communication or further encryption.
    The key derivation function needs to call the hash function.
    Let Hv( ) be the hash function whose outputs are hash values of v bits in length.

    The key derivation function KDF(Z, klen):
    Input: a bit string Z, an integer klen(denoted as the length in bits of secret
           keys to be obtained, which is supposed to be less than (2^32-1)*v).
    Output: a bit string of klen bits in length as the secret key.
    a) Initialize a counter of 32 bits, i.e. ct=0x00000001;
    b) From i=1 to / klen/v \, do:
       b.1) calculate Ha(i)=Hv(Z || ct);
             b.2) ct++;
    c) Let Ha!(/ klen/v \) equal Ha(/ klen/v \) if klen/v is an integer, and let Ha!(/ klen/v \)
       be the left (klen-(v*\ klen/v /)) bits of Ha(/ klen/v \) if not.
    d) let K=Ha(1) || Ha(2) || ... || Ha(/ klen/v \-1) || Ha!(/ klen/v \).

6.1.4.4.  Random Number Generator

   The sm2 key exchange protocol requires random number generators
   approved by Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office.

6.1.5.  Other User Information

   User A has the identifier IDA of length entlenA bits, denote ENTLA as
   the two bytes transformed from the integer entlenA; User B has the
   identifier IDB of length entlenB bits, denote ENTLB as the two bytes
   transformed from the integer entlenB.  In the key exchange protocol
   in this document, both A and B as the participants of key agreement
   need to obtain ZA and ZB by calculating the hash value of ZA and ZB.


   ZA=H256(ENTLA || IDA || a || b || xG || yG || xA || yA)
   ZB=H256(ENTLB || IDB || a || b || xG || yG || xB || yB)

6.2.  Key Exchange Protocol and the Flow Chart

6.2.1.  Key Exchange Protocol


Let user A be the initiator, user B be the responder and klen be the length in bits of
the secret key agreed by user A and user B.
In order to obtain the identical secret key by both user A and user B, they need to
perform the following:
Set w=/(/log2(n)\/2)\-1
USER A:
A1: pick a random number rA in [1, n-1] via a random number generator;
A2: calculate the elliptic curve point RA=[rA]G=(x1, y1);
A3: send RA to user B;
USER B:
B1: pick a random number rB in [1, n-1] via a random number generator;
B2: calculate the elliptic curve point RB=[rB]G=(x2, y2);
B3: calculate x2~=2^w+(x2 AND (2^w-1));
B4: calculate tB=(dB+x2~*rB) modn;
B5: verify whether RA satisfies the elliptic curve equation, agreement failed if not;
otherwise calculate x1~=2^w+(x1 AND (2^w-1));
B6: calculate the elliptic curve point V=[h*tB](PA+[x1~]RA)=(xV, yV), agreement of B
failed if V is the point of infinity;
B7: calculate KB=KDF(xV || yV || ZA || ZB, klen);
B8: (option) calculate SB=Hash(0x02 || yV || Hash(xV || ZA || ZB || x1 || y1 || x2 || y2));
B9: (option) send RB, (option SB) to user A;
USER A:
A4: calculate x1~=2^w+(x1 AND (2^w-1));
A5: calculate tA=(dA+x1~*rA) modn;
A6: verify whether RB satisfies the elliptic curve equation, agreement failed if not;
otherwise calculate x2~=2^w+(x2 AND (2^w-1));
A7: calculate the elliptic curve point U=[h*tA](PB+[x2~]RB)=(xU, yU), agreement of A
failed if U is the point of infinity;
A8: calculate KA=KDF(xU || yU || ZA || ZB, klen);
A9: (option) calculate S1=Hash(0x02 || yU || Hash(xU || ZA || ZB || x1 || y1 || x2 || y2)),
verify whether S1 equals SB, key confirmation from B to A failed if not;
A10: (option) calculate SA=Hash(0x03 || yU || Hash(xU || ZA || ZB || x1 || y1 || x2 || y2)),
send SA to user B;
USER B:
B10: (option) calculate S2=Hash(0x03 || yV || Hash(xV || ZA || ZB || x1 || y1 || x2 || y2)),
verify whether S2 equals SA, key confirmation from A to B failed if not;

Note: The agreement of the shared secret key will certainly fail if ZA or ZB does not
correspond to the hash value of A or B.

7.  SM2 Public Key Encryption Algorithm

7.1.  Parameters of the Algorithm and Auxiliary Functions

7.1.1.  General Rules

   In the public key encryption algorithm, the sender generates
   ciphertext by encrypting the message with the receiver's public key,
   and the receiver recovers the original message by decrypting the
   ciphertext received with his own private key.

7.1.2.  Parameters of Elliptic Curve System

   The parameters of an elliptic curve systme include the size q of a
   finite field Fq (when q=2^m, also include basis representation and
   irreducible polynomial); the two elements a and b (in Fq) which
   defines the elliptic curve equation; the base point G=(xG, yG) (G not
   euqals O), where xG and yG are ellements in Fq; the degree n of G and
   other optional parameter such as cofactor h.

7.1.3.  Key pairs

   The user B's key pair include his private key dB and public key
   PB=[dB]G=(xB, yB).

7.1.4.  Auxiliary Functions

7.1.4.1.  Introduction

   The auxiliary functions in the elliptic curve public key encryption
   algorithm in this document include hash functions, key derivation
   function and random number generator.

7.1.4.2.  Hash Function

   The sm2 public key encryption algorithm requires the hash functions
   approved by Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office,
   such as sm2.

7.1.4.3.  key derivation function


    The key derivation function is used for deriving a secret key from a shared
    secret bit string. In the process of key agreement, the key derivation function
    acts on a secret bit string shared through key exchange to generate a secret
    key used for communication or further encryption.
    The key derivation function needs to call the hash function.
    Let Hv( ) be the hash function whose outputs are hash values of v bits in length.

    The key derivation function KDF(Z, klen):
    Input: a bit string Z, an integer klen(denoted as the length in bits of secret
           keys to be obtained, which is supposed to be less than (2^32-1)*v).
    Output: a bit string of klen bits in length as the secret key.
    a) Initialize a counter of 32 bits, i.e. ct=0x00000001;
    b) From i=1 to / klen/v \, do:
             b.1) calculate Ha(i)=Hv(Z || ct);
           b.2) ct++;
    c) Let Ha!(/ klen/v \) equal Ha(/ klen/v \) if klen/v is an integer, and let Ha!(/ klen/v \)
       be the left (klen-(v*\ klen/v /)) bits of Ha(/ klen/v \) if not.

    d) let K=Ha(1) || Ha(2) || ... || Ha(/ klen/v \-1) || Ha!(/ klen/v \).

7.1.4.4.  Random Number Generator

   The sm2 public key encryption algorithm requires random number
   generators approved by Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration
   Office.

7.2.  Algorithm for Encryption and the Flow Chart

7.2.1.  Algorithm for Encryption


      Let the bit string M be the message for sending, klen be the length
      in bits of M.
      In order to encrypt M, user A need to perform the following:
      A1: pick a random number k in [1, n-1] via a random number generator;
      A2: calculate the elliptic curve point C1=[k]G=(x1, y1);
      A3: calculate the elliptic curve point S=[h]PB, report error and quit
          if S is the point of infinity;
      A4: calculate the elliptic curve point [k]PB=(x2, y2);
      A5: calculate t=KDF(x2 || y2, klen), return to A1 if t is an all zero
          bit string;
      A6: calculate C2=M XOR t;
      A7: calculate C3=Hash(x2 || M || y2);

Appendix C.  Example of Public Key Encryption

C.1.  General Introduction

   This appendix uses the hash algorithm described in
   draft-shen-sm2-hash-00, which applies on a bit string of length less
   than 2^64 and output a hash value of size 256, denotes as H256( ).

   In this appendix, all the hexadecimal number has high digits on the
   left and low digits on the right.

   In this appendix, all the plaintexts are in ASCII code.
